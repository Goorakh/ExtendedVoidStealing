# Extended Void Stealing

A server-side mod that makes void implosions steal more kinds of objects from the environment. Highly configurable.

Currently includes:
* Almost all kinds of interactables (excluding teleporters for obvious reasons)
* Item pickups
* Survovor spawn pods

**Planned future additions:**
  * Rest of interactables: Cauldrons, timed chest on Rallypoint
  * Logbook pickups
  * Aqueduct pressure plates
