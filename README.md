# Extended Void Stealing

A server-side mod that makes void implosions steal more kinds of objects from the environment. Highly configurable.

Currently includes:
* Almost all kinds of interactables (excluding teleporters for obvious reasons)
* Pickups (items, equipment, etc)
* Survivor spawn pods
* Abandoned Aqueduct pressure plates
* The Timed Chest on Rallypoint
* The fans on Rallypoint
